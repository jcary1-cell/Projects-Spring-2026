            By using AI as a collaborator rather than a creator, students had the chance to interact with the responses—revising them, rejecting them, or expanding upon them to craft more nuanced characters. This method forces students to think critically about their desired output before receiving AI input.

            By the end of the project, students had developed characters that could take on some of fiction’s most notorious villains. It showed me that, when used thoughtfully, AI can be a great tool that supports learning instead of replacing it—allowing students to focus more on deep thinking and textual evidence.

            Two years since the launch of ChatGPT as AI’s “killer app,” opinions about the integration of generative AI into college and university curricula has largely bifurcated. There are some who embrace generative AI as an inevitable and essential skill, whereas others engage in principled resistance.

            Writing responses to evaluations, summarizing reports, and drafting institutional memos require thought and consideration, but they also follow familiar, structured formats. In such cases, using generative AI to produce an initial draft is not to relinquish intellectual work. It is instead automation of routine so that we can focus on refining and ensuring the material aligns with our intent.

            As proof of concept, this very editorial was co-written with generative AI. I structured my thoughts in bullet points... the AI assisted in shaping the prose, but the final product required some substantial editing. By approaching generative AI with intention, we preserve cognition, not lose it. Or, put another way: we automate the small stuff.

            Since virtual assistants became available, my partner has been polite to them. He says “please” and “thank you” to Siri every time he makes a request. I used to tease him about this habit, but he always shrugged it off. “We’ll see how it goes when the robots take over,” he would say.

          <p>
            I have since learned that the phrase “robot overlords” is foundationally ironic. As John M. Jordan explains, the word “robot” derives from the Czech word ‘robota,’ or forced labor. Thus, I have come to consider these tools as colleagues, perhaps even comrades.
