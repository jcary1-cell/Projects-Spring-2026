                    <p>When I think about the integration of AI in education and society, I'm reminded of Safiya Noble's "Algorithms of Oppression" and Virginia Eubanks' "Automating Inequality." These scholars remind us that older patterns of economic, social, political, and cultural biases persist into the age of AI.</p>
                    <p>In my recent work, I've applied these perspectives to analyze how national strategies in AI are not just technological races but contests over differing design logics and ethical frameworks. Human intervention, therefore, must focus on a critical examination of training data and the hidden labor that sustains these systems.</p>

                    <p>In my English course, “How to Be Bad: What Makes a Good Villain in Fiction,” the final project originally required a complex character analysis. I realized many students struggled with the "blank page" of creative invention before they could even get to the analytical portion.</p>
                    <p>I redesigned the project to introduce AI as a structured brainstorming tool. Students used prompts to generate "archetype sketches"—brief, often cliché-ridden descriptions of potential villains. Their task was then to take these shells and perform the deep analysis: Why is this character's motivation flawed? What societal anxiety does this villain represent?</p>

                    <p>Students can choose to use AI for specific tasks, but each choice comes with a "cost" of reflection. If they use it to summarize a text, they must then provide a rigorous "fact-check" document against the original source, documenting every hallucination or omitted nuance.</p>

                    <p>Think about the first time you played Super Mario Bros. You didn't beat the game on the first try. You ran into a Goomba, fell into a pit, and missed the jump to the flagpole. But you learned. You iterated. You tried again.</p>
                    <p>In First-Year Writing, I teach AI through this lens of "Play and Iteration." Students design an "AI Writing Team" with distinct personae. One persona, <strong>Kriss Crumbs</strong>, is an adventurer—prone to wild, creative leaps but often getting lost. Another, <strong>Willow the Wordsmith</strong>, is a meticulous editor—precise but often dry.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The students prompt these personae to get feedback on their drafts. The most crucial step is the evaluation: What did Willow get wrong? Why did Kriss's suggestion fail to meet the assignment's goal? Successful collaboration with AI requires embracing iteration and failure, much like mastering a complex video game.</p>

                    <p>There is a persistent fear that using AI is "outsourcing thought." I argue the opposite: by using generative AI to produce an initial draft, we are automating routine labor so that we can focus on higher-level cognition.</p>
                    <p>Think of it like a calculator for prose. A mathematician doesn't lose their understanding of calculus because they use a calculator for long division. Similarly, a writer doesn't lose their voice because they used an LLM to generate a rough outline or a list of transitional phrases.</p>

                    <p>As proof of concept, this very editorial was co-written with generative AI. I provided the structure and the core philosophical claims; the AI assisted in shaping the initial prose.

                    <p>Instead of viewing ChatGPT as a threat, I treated it as a junior assistant. I established my own goals for a specific assignment first, then I asked the "robot" for a grading scale. When it returned something too rigid, I spoke to it: "That's a bit too formal, can we make this more supportive for first-year students?"</p>

                    <p>Workplace culture can be a dry topic for students. To bring it to life, I asked ChatGPT to create online dating ads to help students find which of four workplace cultures—Hierarchy, Market, Clan, or Adhocracy—matched their personality best.</p>
                    <p>The AI generated bios for each culture: "Clan" was a bio about wanting a family-oriented partner who values long-term commitment and shared meals. "Market" was a high-energy bio focused on goals, achievement, and winning together.</p>

                        <p>By framing the search for a job as a "dating" exercise, engagement skyrocketed. Students weren't just reading a textbook; they were looking for their professional soulmate.</p>

                    <p>Crucially, I disclosed the use of AI immediately. I played up the matchmaking angle to show them how AI can be a tool for creative metaphor. AI use should always be disclosed, and I like to model how AI can be used responsibly and transparently.</p>

                    <p>Copilot could not design the course without me, the human in the loop. However, Copilot *could* help me translate my complex pedagogical goals into language that was more accessible to my students.</p>
                    <p>Beyond my own use, I've seen how AI acts as a liberating accessibility tool. For students who struggle with "tact," "professional tone," or standard academic phrasing due to neurodiversity or language barriers, AI provides a bridge. It allows them to participate in discourse that was previously gated by arbitrary conformity to specific linguistic styles.</p>

                    <p>When a student uses AI to help "soften" an email to a professor or "structure" a chaotic list of ideas into a coherent paragraph, they aren't cheating—they are using a tool to overcome a specific hurdle to communication.</p>

                    <p>I was working late, trying to prep a quiz for my forthcoming book. I thought, "I'll just let ChatGPT help." I happily uploaded <strong>AN ENTIRE CHAPTER</strong> of my unpublished research into the text field to generate questions.</p>
                    <p>Five minutes later, the realization hit me like a physical blow: What did I just do? I had shared my original, proprietary research with an LLM that could "memorize," copy verbatim, and generally steal my ideas to train itself or answer someone else's prompt.</p>
